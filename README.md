## What This Mod Does

In vanilla FS25, hired AI workers cost nothing. That makes labor a free resource — which kills any incentive to manage your workforce strategically.

**Realistic Worker Costs** fixes that. Every AI worker you hire accumulates wages in real time and bills your farm at regular intervals. You choose how you want to pay them — by the hour or by the hectare — and you set the rate. Cheap labor, fair wages, or premium crew: the choice has consequences.

The mod ships with a full **in-game manager UI** (accessible from the pause menu), integrates with the vanilla settings screen, and exposes everything via console commands.

## Installation

### From a Release (recommended)

1. Go to the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/TheCodingDad-TisonK/FS25_WorkerCosts/releases/latest)
2. Download `FS25_WorkerCosts.zip`
3. Drop the zip (do **not** extract) into your mods folder:

   ```
   Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\mods\
   ```

4. Launch FS25, enable the mod in the Mod Manager, and start your save

> **Steam users:** Right-click the game → Manage → Browse local files to find your mods path if it differs.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheCodingDad-TisonK/FS25_WorkerCosts.git
cd FS25_WorkerCosts
bash build.sh --deploy
```

---

## Configuration

### In-Game Manager

Open the pause menu → click the **Realistic Worker Costs** tab (the worker icon).

| Page | What's here |
|------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Live status: active workers, next payment countdown, farm balance |
| **Wage Settings** | Cost mode, wage level, notifications, debug toggle, reset button |
| **Worker Stats** | Per-worker cost breakdown, refreshed every 500 ms |
| **About** | How the mod works, wage reference table, current version |

### Vanilla Settings Screen

The mod also injects a **Worker Costs Mod** section into `Pause → Settings → Game` — useful if you prefer the native settings flow. A **Reset Settings** button is added to that screen's footer.

### Settings Reference

| Setting | Options | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Mod Enabled** | On / Off | On | Master switch |
| **Cost Mode** | Hourly / Per Hectare | Hourly | See [Wage System](#wage-system) |
| **Wage Level** | Low / Medium / High | Medium | Ignored when Custom Rate > 0 |
| **Custom Rate** | Any number ≥ 0 | 0 | Set to 0 to use Wage Level |
| **Notifications** | On / Off | On | HUD popup on each payment |
| **Debug Mode** | On / Off | Off | Enables `[Worker Costs]` log lines |

---

## Wage System

### Payment Cycle

Workers are paid every **5 real-world minutes**. The timer runs in real time regardless of your in-game time-speed setting — 4× speed does not charge you 4× more.

Workers dismissed mid-interval are automatically settled at the next payment tick — no unpaid labour.

### Hourly Mode

```
wage = base_rate × hours_worked × skill_multiplier
```

| Tier | Base Rate | Min (skill 0%) | Standard (skill 50%) | Max (skill 100%) |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Low | $15 /h | $12 /h | $15 /h | $18 /h |
| Medium | $25 /h | $20 /h | $25 /h | $30 /h |
| High | $40 /h | $32 /h | $40 /h | $48 /h |

> **Example:** 3 workers on Medium, running for the full 5-minute interval:
> `$25 × (5/60) hours × 1.0 skill × 3 workers = ~$6.25`

### Per-Hectare Mode

```
wage = base_rate × hectares_worked × skill_multiplier
```

Ideal for large field operations — you pay for output, not clock time. Note: implements that don't expose worked area data will report 0 ha and incur no charge.

### Custom Rate

Set any positive number in **Custom Rate** to bypass the tier system entirely. Set it back to `0` to resume using the Wage Level setting.

## Console Commands

Open the console with the **`~`** key:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `workerCosts` | List all available commands |
| `workerCostsStatus` | Show current mod status and active rate |
| `WorkerCostsEnable` | Enable the mod |
| `WorkerCostsDisable` | Disable the mod |
| `WorkerCostsSetWageLevel 1\|2\|3` | `1` = Low · `2` = Medium · `3` = High |
| `WorkerCostsSetCostMode 1\|2` | `1` = Hourly · `2` = Per Hectare |
| `WorkerCostsSetNotifications true\|false` | Toggle payment HUD popups |
| `WorkerCostsSetCustomRate <amount>` | Custom rate (`0` = use Wage Level) |
| `WorkerCostsTestPayment` | Deduct a $100 test charge |
| `WorkerCostsShowSettings` | Full settings dump |
| `WorkerCostsResetSettings` | Reset everything to defaults |
| `wcReloadGui` | Reload the mod GUI without restarting |

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Workers aren't being charged</strong></summary>

1. Run `workerCostsStatus` — confirm `Enabled: true`
2. Make sure AI workers are actually hired and active (not just vehicles parked)
3. Turn on **Debug Mode** and watch `log.txt` for `[Worker Costs]` lines
4. Run `WorkerCostsTestPayment` — if $100 is deducted, the payment system is working fine and the issue is worker detection

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mod doesn't appear in the Settings screen</strong></summary>

1. Confirm the mod is enabled in the Mod Manager before loading the save
2. Check `log.txt` for any load errors
3. The mod section appears under **Pause → Settings → Game** — scroll down if needed

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Settings aren't saving between sessions</strong></summary>

Settings are stored per-savegame at:
```
Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\saves\savegame<N>\FS25_WorkerCostsMod.xml
```
If that file is missing or can't be written, the mod falls back to defaults each load. Check folder permissions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Per-hectare mode charges nothing</strong></summary>

Not all implements expose worked-area data to the game's AI system. If the implement your worker is using doesn't report hectares, the mod has no area to bill — this is a limitation of the FS25 API, not a bug. Switch to Hourly mode for those workflows.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is the log file?</strong></summary>

```
Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\log.txt
```
Search for `[Worker Costs]` — all mod activity (when Debug Mode is on) and any errors are tagged with this prefix.

</details>
