-- PRO-STAFF BUILD CHECKLIST — coordinator wiring in THIS file, ticked per phase
-- (full plan: docs/PRO_STAFF_PLAN.md):
--   [x] Phase 0 — own WorkerRoster; load on mission start; expose save entry
--   [x] Phase 1 — own WorkerJobTracker; subscribe on load, unsubscribe on delete;
--                 flush in-progress jobs before each roster save
--   [x] Phase 2 — XP/level handled by tracker+roster (no extra wiring needed)
--   [x] Phase 3 — pass the roster to WorkerSystem for the labor-cost pipeline
--   [x] Phase 4 — roster reachable via g_WorkerManager.workerRoster; WCWorkerStatsFrame
--                 shows level/fatigue (dashboard/wage-settings columns still pending)
--   [~] Phase 5 — getRosterSnapshot() read API DONE (cross-repo contract for the
--                 Farm Tablet Pro-Staff app); MP roster-sync events still pending
